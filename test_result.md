# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "ISSUE DISCOVERED: Backend API is returning old field names (plan_type, plan_name, base_price, popular) but frontend expects new field names (type, name, price, is_popular). Fixed PlanEditor component field mapping but root cause is backend database has old data structure. Frontend shows 'Loading...' because it can't find expected fields. Backend is using localhost:27017 database while init script tries bnhsite-mongodb:27017. Need to sync database schema with frontend expectations."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "MAJOR FIXES COMPLETED: 1) Fixed backend API field mapping - all endpoints now correctly map database fields to frontend-expected field names (plan_type->type, plan_name->name, base_price->price, popular->is_popular). 2) Fixed frontend filtering logic to work with combined type format (e.g., 'ssd_shared' instead of separate type/sub_type). 3) Fixed frontend .env to use correct backend URL (localhost:8001). 4) Updated PlanEditor component with correct field mappings and database-compatible field names. RESULT: Homepage now displays all 36 hosting plans correctly with proper names, prices, and Popular badges. Admin panel loads 36 plans successfully. All field mapping issues resolved."

    message: "CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES IDENTIFIED: Comprehensive testing reveals multiple critical issues preventing frontend-backend communication: 1) API ROUTING ISSUE: Backend serves at localhost:8001 but frontend expects API at /api prefix - complete communication breakdown. 2) FIELD MAPPING ISSUE: Backend returns old field names (plan_type, plan_name, base_price, popular) but frontend expects new names (type, name, price, is_popular) - causes homepage loading failures. 3) PLAN FILTERING BROKEN: API filters by 'type' field but database has 'plan_type' - all filtering returns 0 results. 4) All 36 hosting plans exist with correct names but are inaccessible to frontend. Authentication system working perfectly. These are the root causes of homepage and admin panel issues."

    message: "NAVIGATION MENU ADMIN ENDPOINTS TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing confirms Navigation Menu admin endpoints are working perfectly and the 'Error updating navigation: [object Object]' issue is completely RESOLVED. ✅ GET /api/admin/navigation: Returns navigation items correctly (tested with initial 2 items, can handle empty state). ✅ POST /api/admin/navigation: Successfully accepts JSON array of navigation items and saves them to database. Tested with sample data: [{'id':'1','label':'Home','href':'/','order':1,'is_external':false}, {'id':'2','label':'Hosting','href':'#hosting','order':2,'is_external':false}]. ✅ PUT /api/admin/navigation: Works as alternative method for updating navigation data. ✅ Data Persistence: Navigation items are correctly saved to database and persist between requests. Verified by saving 2 items via POST, updating to 3 items via PUT, and confirming persistence with GET. ✅ Authentication: admin/admin123 credentials working perfectly with proper JWT token validation. ✅ Error Resolution: All endpoints return proper success responses with 'Navigation updated successfully' messages. No more 'Not Found' errors. All 7 navigation-specific tests passed (100% success rate). The Navigation Menu functionality in the admin panel is fully operational and ready for production use."
