The previous AI engineer was tasked with transforming Blue Nebula Hosting from WordPress to a FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack, with a critical focus on integrating a custom Blesta billing theme. The initial approach involved building a *new* Blesta theme, causing significant compatibility and display issues. This led to multiple iterations of fixes, where the AI engineer repeatedly attempted to resolve styling, visibility, and functionality problems (e.g., white-on-white text, broken menus, sliders, cart pages, logo issues) within its own custom theme structure.

A major turning point occurred when the user explicitly provided the *correct* default Blesta Bootstrap theme structure and documentation, clarifying that the AI should *modify* the existing theme, not create a new one. Following this, the AI engineer shifted its strategy, creating a new, cleaner theme directory () and focusing on modifying  and  as per best practices. Despite this, persistent issues with card backgrounds, logo loading, footer styling, and dropdown visibility necessitated further iterative fixes, often requiring increasingly aggressive CSS and JavaScript overrides.

A significant breakthrough came with the implementation of a JavaScript  fallback for logo images, finally addressing the long-standing logo loading problem. The final iterations revolved around refining visual elements, including background animations (oscillating between stars and nebula clouds, eventually settling on stars with shooting stars) and header/footer blending, ensuring aesthetic consistency with the main website. The core challenge throughout was the intricate and often overriding nature of Blesta's template and CSS system, requiring targeted and at times, aggressive, styling adjustments.

<product_requirements>
Blue Nebula Hosting requires a modern website replacing WordPress, featuring Shared (SSD/HDD), VPS (Standard/Performance), and GameServer (Standard/Performance) hosting plans. The site must embody a blue/tech space theme, be white-labeled (no Vultr mention), and integrate with existing services: Blesta (billing.bluenebulahosting.com), Pterodactyl (panel.bluenebulahosting.com), and Uptime Kuma (status.bluenebulahosting.com/status/bnh). Specific pricing and plan details, including 20% markup for VPS and 40% for GameServers, must be accurately implemented. A content management system (CMS) for easy updates and a seamlessly matching Blesta billing theme are essential. The Blesta theme specifically required fixes for numerous display and functionality issues (missing images, broken login/menu/footer links, illegible text, broken sliders, blank cart pages) and needed to be a customization of the *existing* default Blesta Bootstrap theme, not a new, separate theme. The Blue Nebula Hosting name should appear as one continuous name, not with Hosting as a separate tagline. The background animation should be stars, potentially with shooting stars.

The application comprises a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database, along with a custom-themed Blesta client area.



**Key Files and their importance (focusing on Blesta theme changes):**

-   : Manages FastAPI backend API endpoints, primarily for hosting plan details. It was modified to handle 36 diverse hosting plans and their data persistence in MongoDB.
-   : The main React component rendering the Blue Nebula Hosting website and integrating with backend APIs. It was updated to fetch 36 plans and include routing for the  panel.
-   : Provides a Content Management System (CMS) interface for real-time editing of hosting plan details via the  route.
-   : This is the *new, correct* directory for the custom Blesta theme, following the user's explicit guidance to modify the existing Bootstrap theme.
    -   : Updated theme configuration, including name, author, and Blesta version requirements. This file defines metadata for the theme.
    -   : The main template file for the Blesta theme. It has been extensively modified to:
        *   Integrate the Blue Nebula Hosting branding, including logo and favicon references (now directly loaded with JavaScript  fallback).
        *   Restructure the header and footer to match the main website's design, removing the Hosting tagline from the company name.
        *   Include custom CSS () and JavaScript for dynamic styling fixes.
        *   Manage z-index for navigation and dropdowns to prevent blocking.
        *   Re-introduce starfield background animation and add HTML elements for shooting stars.
    -   : This is the primary stylesheet for the new Blesta theme. It has been heavily modified to:
        *   Apply the blue/tech space theme colors (blue, purple, green) and gradients.
        *   Implement aggressive CSS overrides to fix white background issues on cards, panels, and text elements.
        *   Ensure text visibility by forcing high-contrast colors.
        *   Style the merged footer to match the main site's 4-column layout and remove overlays.
        *   Fix dropdown menu styling and z-index issues.
        *   Remove unwanted hover animations on package descriptions.
        *   Control the background starfield and shooting star animations.
    -   , : These files are intended to contain the Blue Nebula branding assets, directly referenced in .
-   : Provides instructions on installing the newly created and properly structured Blesta theme.
-   : Contains general project documentation for the Blesta theme.

The evolution of the  directory from a problematic custom creation to the  directory, which correctly integrates with the default Blesta Bootstrap theme by using an  and modifying , is the most critical architectural shift.

<pending_tasks>
There are no explicit pending tasks from the user's last direct requests. The last requests were to change the background back to stars and add shooting stars, both of which the AI engineer has stated are complete.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on refining the visual aspects of the Blesta theme. The user had specifically requested to revert the background animation from Nebula Clouds back to stars and to add shooting stars.

The AI engineer addressed this by:
1.  **Reverting Background**: Modified  and  to re-implement the twinkling starfield background animation.
2.  **Adding Shooting Stars**: Enhanced  to include HTML elements for shooting stars and updated  with corresponding CSS animations to make them streak across the sky with varied timing and trajectories.

The current state of the product's Blesta theme is that it features a blue/tech space theme with a twinkling starfield background and occasional shooting stars, matching the main website's aesthetic. All previous functionality and visibility issues, including card styling, text legibility, logo integration, footer design, and dropdown menus, are reportedly resolved through aggressive CSS overrides and JavaScript fallbacks. The theme is now structured following Blesta's best practices, residing in .
