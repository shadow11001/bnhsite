The AI engineer systematically addressed numerous functional and architectural issues in the Blue Nebula Hosting application, transitioning it from an MVP to a more production-ready state. Initial efforts focused on frontend display issues, specifically a sticky promo banner and correcting field name mismatches for hosting plans. A major push involved Dockerizing the application, which necessitated extensive Caddy reverse proxy configuration and debugging API routing ( prefix issues). Concurrently, database initialization and consistency challenges, alongside frontend data display discrepancies, were tackled. Subsequent work added customizable Order Now URLs and integrated technical specifications (CPU, RAM, Disk, Bandwidth) into plan displays. The engineer then debugged a complex set of admin panel issues related to content management (Website Content, Navigation, Company Info, SMTP, Promo Codes, Site Settings), addressing Not Found and 422 errors by fixing API endpoints, HTTP methods, and implementing robust caching prevention. The final efforts centered on ensuring database consistency via  and resolving persistent content loading/saving issues in the admin panel by correcting backend endpoints and frontend state management.

<product_requirements>
Blue Nebula Hosting is a white-labeled hosting website built with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, intended to replace a WordPress setup. It offers Shared (SSD/HDD), VPS (Standard/Performance), and GameServer (Standard/Performance) hosting plans with specific markups (20% for VPS, 40% for GameServers). The site needs a blue/tech space theme, integration with Blesta for billing, Pterodactyl for game servers, and Uptime Kuma for system status. A real-time CMS is required for updating website content (hero, about, features), legal pages, company information, navigation menus, and site settings. A robust promo code system with dismissible floating banners and custom URLs is essential. The Blesta theme needs custom Bootstrap modifications to fix display and branding. Core functionalities include secure admin panel access, dynamic content management, correct display of hosting plans with technical specifications (CPU, RAM, Disk, Bandwidth) and customizable order URLs, a functional system status page, and a fully operational promo code system. All admin sections like Website Content, Navigation, Company Info, SMTP, Site Settings, and Promo Codes must load and save correctly, with changes persisting in the database without requiring rebuilds.

**Key Files and their importance:**

-   : Core FastAPI backend. Handles API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Removed  prefix from  to fix double-prefixing with Caddy. Added field mapping in API responses (e.g.,  to ,  to ) for , , . Implemented reverse field mapping for . Added new admin API endpoints for content management (GET/POST/PUT ) and a debug endpoint ().
-   : Main React application for displaying hosting plans.
    -   **Changes**: Updated hosting plan filtering logic to match production database schema (using  and  fields, initially converted  to separate  and , then reverted to use combined  based on production API). Corrected field mapping for displaying plans (, , ). Added display for technical specifications (, , , ). Made Order Now buttons use  with a fallback. Implemented cache-busting for API calls.
-   : Admin panel for content management.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected API URLs for fetching/updating plans, removed double . Fixed field mapping for editing hosting plans. Added input fields for shared hosting specifics (domains, subdomains, parked domains, databases, email accounts) and made markup percentage editable. Added  field to PlanEditor. Rewrote Website Content management to handle section-specific content, use correct  endpoints (with fallbacks and robust error handling) and prevent duplication. Fixed Navigation, Company Info, Site Settings, Contact & SMTP API calls to use  prefixed endpoints. Enhanced promo codes loading with fallbacks. Added global Refresh Data and Clear Cache buttons, along with cache-busting mechanisms. Fixed admin panel filtering for plans to use  instead of .
-   : Frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes**:  was temporarily changed to  for local testing, then reverted to  for production.
-   : Database initialization script.
    -   **Changes**: Verified and updated existing hosting plan data with new field names (, , , ). Added  to all 36 hosting plans. Ensured shared hosting plans include specific fields like , , , , . Enhanced website content structure to include , ,  sections with , , , , . Added  initialization.

<pending_tasks>
-   The user is still reporting Error Updating Content: Not Found and content not loading in the admin panel's Website Content section, indicating the backend API changes made in  for content management might not be fully functional or accessible in the user's environment.
-   The Contact & SMTP settings were stated as IMPROVED but their full functionality (saving and testing) is dependent on the backend endpoints being correctly implemented and accessible in the user's environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in debugging and resolving issues related to the Website Content section within the admin panel. The user reported that content was still not loading into the edit fields and that saving content resulted in an Error Updating Content: Not Found. This occurred despite the AI engineer having previously implemented extensive frontend and backend fixes for content management, including creating new backend API endpoints () in  and refactoring frontend state management and API calls in  to address content duplication and saving errors.

The current debugging process involved:
1.  **Re-evaluating Backend Endpoints**: The AI engineer identified that newly added content endpoints might not be properly routed in the production environment, specifically looking at how  was included and if endpoints were added directly to the FastAPI  instance.
2.  **Adding Debugging Endpoints**: A  route was added to  to allow verification of available routes in the running backend.
3.  **Frontend Authentication Check**: Ensured the frontend was using the correct  key () for authentication headers in .
4.  **Restarting Services**: Backend and frontend services were restarted to ensure the latest code changes (new endpoints, debugging logic) were picked up.

The AI engineer's internal testing revealed that the new content endpoints were accessible locally, but the user's production environment continued to report Not Found errors, suggesting a potential routing or deployment discrepancy between the local development setup and the user's production Kubernetes environment. The engineer concluded that the frontend code for content management is now COMPLETELY FIXED and robust, awaiting a resolution of backend endpoint accessibility in the user's environment.

Investigate why the  endpoints are Not Found in the user's production environment, despite being configured in the backend.
